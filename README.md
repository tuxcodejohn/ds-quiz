1..5 for the earliest player. If that button press really was a
mistake you can cancel the state with Esc and return back to the
previous Scoreboard screen.

The moderator listens to the candidates answer and pushes a/b/c/d
accordingly. The candidates can be given time to rethink their
choice. Return will confirm the choice, hilight right/wrong answers
and bump the score of the player.

Press space again to end this screen and return to the Scoreboard.
